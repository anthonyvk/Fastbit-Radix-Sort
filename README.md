# Fastbit-Radix-Sort
Fastbit is an optimized version of radix sort algorithm. It works at binary representation of integer data set. It performs bitwise AND operation on the integer data to extract the bit, whereas the existing radix sort algorithm extracts the digit by performing division and modulus operation.
